A string is not a datatype but it is a 1D array of characters.

If we want to store several such strings, then we will require a 2D array of characters.

char names[5][10] = {"manas","om","nihar","abhiram","ajay"};  // OK

Though the names appear as 1D array, why is it declared as a 2D array? It is bcoz it is a 1D array of strings, but the problem is that there is no datatype called as "string". So when represented as an array, it is represented as 2D array & which we can well understand using foll. fig
                     R  C
char names[5][10] = {
		"manas",
		"om",
		"nihar",
		"abhiram",
		"ajay"
		};     // OK & more convincing when represented in the form rows & columns
