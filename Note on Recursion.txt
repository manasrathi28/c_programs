Recursion

When a call is given to the same function from itself, then the function is said to be a "recursive function" & the process is known as "recursion" OR if the calling & called functions are same, then the function is said to be a recursive function.

Recursion is sometimes looked upon as a substitute for looping commands. The recursive function should contain a conditional statement to terminate the recursion, otherwise it will lead to an error similar to "infinite loop".
