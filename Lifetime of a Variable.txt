Lifetime of a variable

This indicates the availability/validity of a variable during the course of execution of a program. Variables declared in function scope perish (get destroyed) the moment the entire code in the function gets executed. However, if local variables of a function are declared using "static" keyword, then they remain in memory till the end of execution of the program.

Global variables remain in memory till the end of execution of program i.e. have same lifetime as that of static local vars.
