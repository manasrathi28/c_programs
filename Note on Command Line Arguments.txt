Command Line Arguments

It is possible to pass parameters/arguments to our C program from command line. These args are accepted by our program through main( ). Traditionally they are called as "argc" & "argv". "argc" is argument counter & is an int value. It is used to know the no of arguments passed to main() & is extremely useful for validation purpose. "argv" is argument vector & is basically an array of pointers to strings. It is used to read the value of argument.

So the syntax of main() now becomes

int main(int argc,char *argv[ ])
{




}

To run an application, we are henceforth going to create "exe" files i.e. self executable files which can be executed directly from OS. The source code of a program/application cannot be viewed/displayed from "exe" file.
