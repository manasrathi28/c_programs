The "switch case" command

This command is used in decision making like the "if" command. However it has some limitations like it can work with char or int datatypes only & doesn't permit the use of logical operators or relational operators. It is typically used with do.....while loops in Menu Driven Programs.

It's syntax is

switch(var or expression)
{
	case value1:
		do this1;
		do this2;
		.......
		break;

	case value2:
		do that1;
		do that2;
		........
		break;

	.......................

	default:  // not compulsory, will execute if above cases are not satisfied
		do this;
		do that;
}
